*Clap on. Clap off. The clapper!*

This is a silly hackday project that lets you "click" your computer by clapping.
It uses XNA to capture sound from a microphone and waits for a certain interval
between impulses (i.e. the distinctive Clap... Clap) before raising an event.

The UI uses the clapper class to send a `space` character to what ever window
is currently active. In my demo, I used it to advance PowerPoint slides.

It's silly, it's fun and it has a funny video to go with it.
